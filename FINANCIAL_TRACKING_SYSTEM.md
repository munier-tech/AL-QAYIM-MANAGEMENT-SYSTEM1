## How It Works

### 1. Student Fees → Income
```javascript
// Automatically calculates total paid student fees for the month
const studentFeesResult = await Fee.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      month: monthNum, 
      year: yearNum, 
      paid: true 
    } 
  },
  { 
    $group: { 
      _id: null, 
      total: { $sum: "$amount" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    } 
  }
]);
```

### 2. Teacher Salaries → Expenses
```javascript
// Automatically calculates total paid teacher salaries for the month
const teacherSalariesResult = await Salary.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      month: monthNum, 
      year: yearNum, 
      paid: true 
    } 
  },
  { 
    $group: { 
      _id: null, 
      total: { $sum: "$totalAmount" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    } 
  }
]);
```

### 3. Unpaid Fees → Debt
```javascript
// Tracks unpaid student fees as debt
const unpaidFeesResult = await Fee.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      month: monthNum, 
      year: yearNum, 
      paid: false 
    } 
  },
  { 
    $group: { 
      _id: null, 
      total: { $sum: "$amount" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    } 
  }
